# Setup
 Download 'clock' into `/bin` or `/usr/bin` directory and make it executable using `cd /usr/bin` `chmod +x clock`, make sure `/usr/bin` is in `$PATH`. 
 
 Alternatively, save it wherever you want and make an alias in `~/.bashrc`. Something like `alias clock='bash /path/to/file'`
 
# Usage
 Type `clock` into your terminal and enjoy!
 
 You can modify clock's behaviour using switches. Check out `clock -h` for more info.
